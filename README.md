##Inspiration
Going to accomplish the task set out by codeandcoffeelb/codeandcoffeelb.github.io#40

```
are you open for me to create a little angularJS webiste for this?

I can simply follow this guide that I found for slack:

https://levels.io/slack-typeform-auto-invite-sign-ups/

and have it post to slack, and using githubs api:

https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/members/#add-or-update-organization-membership

And this could all be hosted on signup.codeandcoffeelb.com

Just let me know and I can this get this done in about a week or two :)
```
